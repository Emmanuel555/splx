# splx
splx is a C++ BSpline/Bezier library with quadratic programming extensions. Include bezier.h, bspline.h, or spline.h depending on which type of curves you want to use.

Check test/testbezier.cpp, test/testbspline.cpp, test/spline.cpp for example implementations.

The components of Spline<T, DIM>s can be Bezier<T,DIM>s or BSpline<T,DIM>s.

# Dependencies
This library requires Eigen3 [http://eigen.tuxfamily.org].
